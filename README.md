# devWithMe - Productivity Dashboard

## About This Project

I created devWithMe as a solution to a problem I faced daily: managing productivity effectively as a student. It's challenging to balance academic responsibilities, personal projects, and finances all at once. Traditional productivity apps often focus on only one aspect, making it difficult to get a complete view of my life in one place.

## The Problem

As a student, I struggled with:

- **Managing multiple projects and tasks** across different courses and personal interests
- **Tracking study time effectively** and maintaining focus during long study sessions
- **Monitoring my limited income and expenses** to ensure I could make it through each month
- **Visualizing my productivity data** to identify areas for improvement
- **Organizing my thoughts and ideas** for projects in a structured way

## The Solution: devWithMe

devWithMe combines several essential productivity tools into one integrated application:

### üïí Pomodoro Timer
- Focus-enhancing timer with customizable work/break intervals
- Music integration with popular study playlists
- Session tracking to monitor study habits

### ‚úÖ Task Management
- Create and organize tasks by category and priority
- Set deadlines and track completion
- Build habits with recurring tasks and streak tracking

### üí∞ Finance Tracker

- Categorize transactions for better financial awareness
- View financial trends with intuitive charts and visualizations

### üìä Dashboard

## Why I Built This

As a student, I found myself constantly juggling between different apps for different aspects of my life. I needed a task manager for assignments, a time tracker for study sessions, and a finance app for my limited budget. Switching between these tools was inefficient and often led to things falling through the cracks.

devWithMe represents my solution to this fragmentation. It's designed to be the single source of truth for my productivity, helping me stay on track with my goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## Future Plans

I'm continuously improving devWithMe with features like:

- Mobile app version for on-the-go productivity
- Calendar integration for better scheduling
- Goal setting and tracking
- Note-taking and knowledge management
- GitHub integration for developer-specific tasks
